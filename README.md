Hello Nexora,

My name is Yash Kamble and Thank you for responding to my application on Internshala with an assignment and i am grateful for this opportunity to showcase my skills in Full Stack Development. 

I have completed the assigment that i was assigned to me. I have created it with the help of MongoDB, ReactJs, ExpressJs and NodeJs.

I also used several npm libraries like fontawesome, axios for API calls and tailwindCSS for designing purposes.

For responsive and quick navigation within the web app i have used react-router-dom package to create routing of the different pages within my web app.

I have also used react-hot-toast for error handling and showing messages regarding the web app or the current action the web app is performing.

For state management i have used ContextAPI through which i was able to create and manage a global general state from which the state was emitted to all the pages and components of the app and the functions and state variables exposed by the Context was available and accessible to all pages.

Because of using Context i was able to implement an API first approach where the state is only updated if the API calls go through successfully. Which ensures that there's limited optimistic updates and the data that has been shown has been reflected in the backend and the database and those changes are validated.

I used fileURLToPath package which is built in to store the static assets (In this case, the product images) in the server directory.

I have neatly stored the server logic in seperate folders for ease of understanding. From models and Database configuration to Controllers.

Since there was no authentication related objective mentioned in the assignment, I have not created any authentication middleware or protected any routes.

I have created the API endpoints using ExpressJs and incorporated a MongoDB database using mongoose npm package.  

I hope you find my submission appealing.



Thank You,
Yash Kamble.
